## Next Steps

### To Use This Feature:

1. **Install OpenAI Package:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install openai>=1.0.0
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-...your-key..."
   export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-3.5-turbo"
   export OPENAI_MAX_IDEAS="8"
   ```

3. **Run Migration:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

4. **Restart Backend:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

5. **Test the Feature:**
   - Load index.html
   - Select a data source with a client
   - Click on a dimension in the treemap
   - Click "Generate Ideas"
   - Review and accept/reject ideas
   - Visit the client dashboard

### For Production Deployment:

1. **Update Railway Environment Variables:**
   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Add `OPENAI_MODEL`
   - Add `OPENAI_MAX_IDEAS`

2. **Deploy Backend:**
   - Push code to GitHub
   - Railway will auto-deploy
   - Migration runs automatically

3. **Test in Production:**
   - Verify OpenAI API calls work
   - Check data privacy (only samples sent)
   - Test error handling
   - Verify multi-client isolation

## Architecture Decisions

### Why This Design?

1. **Dimension-Level Ideas**: Each dimension gets its own ideas because each survey question has unique insights.

2. **Store All Generated Ideas**: Maintaining history (accepted/rejected) allows for learning and improving the AI prompts over time.

3. **Client-Scoped**: All ideas belong to a client, preparing for multi-tenant user management.

4. **Separate Dashboard**: Provides a focused workspace for reviewing ideas without cluttering the visualization.

5. **Context Storage**: Storing the prompt and context allows auditing what data was used and improving prompts.

6. **Priority System**: Simple 1-3 scale (High/Medium/Low) makes prioritization easy without over-complicating.
