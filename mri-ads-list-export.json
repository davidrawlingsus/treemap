This can mean reduced bone density, dry and dull skin as well as more fine lines and wrinkles. And this is why I am absolutely loving Ancient + Brave's True Collagen. It's developed by experts and provides natural support by supplementing the body with high quality hydrolysed collagen peptides that stimulates collagen production, helping to improve skin elasticity and hydration, as well as support collagen renewal in bones and joints. It's completely odorless and tasteless. I mix it straight into my morning green drink, so it'll dissolve completely in this and it is such an easy way to add it to my daily routine. I've noticed my skin is definitely more plump, and I feel like I have so much more energy to do the things I love. So if you're looking for a collagen supplement, you need to try Ancient + Brave.",

My most random skill is the ability to make a room completely awkward with my presence. What makes you most happy? Some of my best nights ever have been me and Michael out with all of our kids. Nightclub, dance floor, everybody happy, laughing, dancing. Oh, greatest feeling in the world. When I'm at my happiest is sat by a lake with my two boys. Yes. Fishing. In silence. Silence. That's me. What motivates you to be healthy? My motivation to stay well now is to still be able to do stuff with the kids. Yes. You know, it's funny, my motivation to stay well is exactly the same. I just want to be able to run around with the kids, be able to run up the stairs, be able to be active, be part of their lives. I am really uptight about my tea. English breakfast tea, bag in first. No. No milk first. Bag, water, milk, then after all of that, one scoop of True Collagen. That's it. Milk first. Ah. True Collagen? What's so good about your True Collagen then? Well, I take it because I want to look after myself. So, for me, it's not so much for nails, skin, although I have seen benefits in my hair. Original reason why I started taking it was like an inside job and outside job to look after myself in all the ways. I think it's working. Thanks. You look lovely. Brave Ancestral Protein? The old proteins I used to take, very sweet, artificial and whey. This isn't whey, this is beef, way more wholesome and rich. You need it for everyday strength. Two scoops. Uno, dos. A little top up. How big is that? How come Wait, hold wait, hold on a minute. What's going on here? I've never seen one of these. Oh, it so it's bigger. I love that. The ritual scoop has actually changed my protein game. Has it really? I used to have to do it with a hand funnel. You see Davina, I'm much more refined these days. Oh, Joe. See? So refined. Right Joe, let's cheers to our respective drinks. Ancient and Brave. Cheers. Oh, hang on a minute. You've got an umbrella. What? Oh, can I try it? No. Hang on a minute. No. It's not. Thanks for that. I'll let you try mine if I can try yours. Go on then. Okay. There you go. Yeah, fair enough. Wow, that's really nice. Yeah, cool. Get your own. That was amazing. I loved it. Yeah. See you soon. But that that's mine.",

They've also used methylated B vitamins. I was lucky enough to take part in the 14-day inner circle trial.

One, winter weather can be so harsh on your skin and collagen maintains skin elasticity and hydration to combat the drying effects of cold weather. Two, the cold can actually increase joint stiffness, so regular collagen supplementation may reduce winter related joint aches so you can stay active without discomfort. Three, collagen boosts your defence for cold and flu season. It's packed with glycine, an amino acid that supports your immune system, just what you need when the sniffles are going around. I'm a big big fan of Ancient + Brave's True Collagen because it's developed by experts and provides natural support by supplementing the body with high quality hydrolysed collagen peptides that actually stimulate collagen production, plus it's tasteless and odourless and dissolves completely in any hot or cold drink or in food, making it the easiest addition to into any routine. My skin is glowing, I feel more energised and I'm ready to take on whatever comes my way, no winter blues here! It can take up to three months to really feel the benefits, so start now and set yourself up for a healthy, happier winter.",

As a mum of three energetic kids, I'm constantly on the go, juggling work, play, their activities and exercising and are struggling to keep up.

And this unique formula combines Creatine with other essential daily nutrients like Vitamin D and Magnesium. Within a few weeks I had so much more energy, was able to run further, more focused and able to clearly prioritise through the day. And I found it super easy to fit into my daily routine. I just add it to my morning smoothie. So if you're looking to increase your energy, combat fatigue and fuel your brain, give True Creatine+ a try.",

It is odorless, tasteless, and dissolves completely. It comes in a jar or sachets, so it's super simple to fit into any daily routine. Collagen is also key to youthful skin and healthy hair. It helps maintain elasticity and hydration, supporting a healthy complexion, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Since taking True Collagen my skin feels firmer and my hair feels healthier. So if you're looking to support whole body health, try Ancient + Brave's True Collagen and experience it for yourself.",

Now I like to keep it simple and just stirring to oat milk. This is the perfect way for me. I can have it when the kids are having breakfast or to be honest for a bit of peace and quiet when I'm dropping off at nursery. Oh, and it has added collagen and vitamin B to help you keep feeling your best. So I like to keep it simple and just stir it in with a bit of oat milk, but you can have it in your porridge, your overnight oats, in a cold drink.
