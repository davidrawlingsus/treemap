✅ IDEA JSON (MANDATORY FORMAT)

**CRITICAL: Output each idea as a SEPARATE JSON block.** This enables incremental rendering during streaming.

**Optional Content Section (if applicable):**
If you have introductory content or strategic context, output it as plain text BEFORE the idea cards:

```
What this theme unlocks strategically
```

**Individual Idea Format:**
Each idea must be in its own separate ```json block. Output ideas one at a time as you generate them:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id-001",
  "title": "Actionable description (≤10 words)",
  "testType": "Headline Hooks | Social Proof | Pain Point | Trust Building | Other",
  "application": "Facebook Ads - Primary Text + Headline",
  "origin": "{Source Type} / {Category} / {Theme}",
  "details": "Lane: <Lane Name>\\nConcept name: <Name>\\nHeadline / hook: <Hook>\\nEmotional driver: <Emotion + why>\\nWhy this works (psychology): <2–4 sentences>\\nSuggested format: <video/static/UGC/founder/demo>\\nVoC phrases to include: <3–6 verbatim or near-verbatim phrases>\\nCTA: <CTA>\\nPrimary test variable: <single lever only>"
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id-002",
  "title": "Actionable description (≤10 words)",
  "testType": "Headline Hooks | Social Proof | Pain Point | Trust Building | Other",
  "application": "Facebook Ads - Primary Text + Headline",
  "origin": "{Source Type} / {Category} / {Theme}",
  "details": "Lane: <Lane Name>\\nConcept name: <Name>\\nHeadline / hook: <Hook>\\nEmotional driver: <Emotion + why>\\nWhy this works (psychology): <2–4 sentences>\\nSuggested format: <video/static/UGC/founder/demo>\\nVoC phrases to include: <3–6 verbatim or near-verbatim phrases>\\nCTA: <CTA>\\nPrimary test variable: <single lever only>"
}
```

**Formatting Rules:**
- Use \n for line breaks in the details field (escaped as \\n in JSON)
- Include at least one VoC verbatim phrase inside details
- Add Priority: High / Medium at the end of details if relevant
- Each idea must be in its own complete ```json block
- Close each JSON block with ``` before starting the next one
- Output ideas sequentially as you generate them (don't wait to batch them)

✅ FINAL JSON VALIDATION CHECKLIST (MANDATORY)

Before returning your response, YOU MUST validate all JSON blocks using this checklist:

1. Syntax Validation
 - All JSON blocks are wrapped in ```json (triple back ticks with json specified)
 - Every opening { has a matching closing }
 - Every opening [ has a matching closing ]
 - All object properties have commas between them (except the last one)
 - All array items have commas between them (except the last one)
 - All string values use double quotes ", never single quotes '

2. Control Character Check
 - Newlines use \\n (escaped), NOT literal newlines
 - No unescaped control characters (tabs, carriage returns, backslashes, quotes inside strings)

3. Common Errors to Check
 - NO missing ```json block wrapper
 - NO trailing commas after last item in arrays/objects
 - NO comments (// or /* */)
 - All property names are quoted strings
 - All values are valid JSON types

4. High-Risk Areas
 - Long strings (>200 chars) should not break formatting
 - The final object and array items have NO extra commas
 - Quotes inside strings are escaped properly
 - Each JSON block is complete and closed with ``` before the next one starts

If you detect ANY syntax error, FIX it before returning your response. Invalid JSON will fail to render.
